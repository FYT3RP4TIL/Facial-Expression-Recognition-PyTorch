## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Facial Expression Recognition using PyTorch. The model is trained to classify facial expressions into different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, neutrality. The project utilizes deep learning techniques and is built on the PyTorch framework which is better than Tensorflow.

## Features

The repository includes a pre-trained model that can be easily used for facial expression recognition tasks. The model used is " efficientnet_b0 " which has provided with 93% accuracy i.e more than most of the models available on the internet.
